# Configuration for generating Noisy Speech Dataset

# - sampling_rate: Specify the sampling rate. Default is 16 kHz
# - audioformat: default is .wav
# - audio_length: Minimum Length of each audio clip (noisy and clean speech) in seconds that will be generated by augmenting utterances. 
# - silence_length: Duration of silence introduced between clean speech utterances.
# - total_hours: Total number of hours of data required. Units are in hours. 
# - snr_lower: Lower bound for SNR required (default: 0 dB)
# - snr_upper: Upper bound for SNR required (default: 40 dB)
# - target_level_lower: Lower bound for the target audio level before audiowrite (default: -35 dB)
# - target_level_upper: Upper bound for the target audio level before audiowrite (default: -15 dB)
# - total_snrlevels: Number of SNR levels required (default: 5, which means there are 5 levels between snr_lower and snr_upper)
# - clean_activity_threshold: Activity threshold for clean speech
# - noise_activity_threshold: Activity threshold for noise
# - fileindex_start: Starting file ID that will be used in filenames
# - fileindex_end: Last file ID that will be used in filenames
# - is_test_set: Set it to True if it is the test set, else False for the training set
# - noise_dir: Specify the directory path to all noise files
# - Speech_dir: Specify the directory path to all clean speech files
# - noisy_destination: Specify path to the destination directory to store noisy speech
# - clean_destination: Specify path to the destination directory to store clean speech
# - noise_destination: Specify path to the destination directory to store noise speech
# - log_dir: Specify path to the directory to store all the log files

# Configuration for unit tests
# - snr_test: Set to True if SNR test is required, else False
# - norm_test: Set to True if Normalization test is required, else False
# - sampling_rate_test: Set to True if Sampling Rate test is required, else False
# - clipping_test: Set to True if Clipping test is required, else False
# - unit_tests_log_dir: Specify path to the directory where you want to store logs
